Retrieve the positions of numbers which are divisible by 2 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] , 
the output should be neat and understandable, no restrictions are kept on the format of representation of the output.  


<?php
$num i=1;
$cnt=0;
while(i<=20)
 {
   if((i%2==0))
   {
     echo "string position:"strpos[$i];
    }
    i++;
 }
